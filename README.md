# Simple projects

These are a bunch of simple assigned exercizes using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, java servlets and JSP.
Some of these are probably a little too simple but it demonstrates some basic knowledge.
For any code that has a "Complete function" comment, all of the code within the function was written by me, only the function names were given.
Some of these pages only work on certain browsers.
